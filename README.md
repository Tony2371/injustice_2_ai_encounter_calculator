This script calculates win probability of an encounter in AI battle simulator. Algorithm suggests fighters to maximize winning chance

Done:
- SQLite database
- trained neural network
- probability calculator

To do:
- implement automatic HP bar parsing
- fill column 'hp_left' in database to improve neural network prediction
- add column 'hp_left' to training dataset
- fix level_icon detection
- dynamic switch of fighter_1 and fighter_2 columns for neural training
- fighter_1 and fighter_2 should share same index list
