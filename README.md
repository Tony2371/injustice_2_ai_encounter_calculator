The goal of the project to achieve at least top100 rank in online AI Battle simulator in Injustice 2. The project involves computer vision (without neural networks) techniques to collect game info from raw pixel data. This data is stored in SQLite database. It includes information about characters' levels and their AI parameters. Collected data is used to train neural network to predict match outcome based on fighter characteristics. It can also suggest how to tweak AI settings to maximize your fighting advantage in a particular encounter.
