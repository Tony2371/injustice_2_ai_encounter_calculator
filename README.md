The project involves computer vision techniques (without neural networks) to collect game info from raw pixel data. This data is stored in SQLite database. It includes information about characters' levels and their AI parameters. Collected data is used to train neural network to predict match outcome based on fighter characteristics. It can also suggest how to tweak AI settings to maximize your fighting advantage in a particular encounter.
