This script calculates win probability of an encounter in AI battle simulator. Algorithm suggests fighters to maximize winning chance

Done:
- SQLite database
- trained neural network
- probability calculator
- fighter_1 and fighter_2 should share same index list

To do:
- calculate Fighter_1 advantage instead of winning chance (Fighter_1_Health_Left - Fighter_2_Health_Left)
- fix level_icon detection
- dynamic switch of fighter_1 and fighter_2 columns for neural training
